        <h2> Capacitive Sensor: Liquid Volume Sensor</h2>
        <p>
          Originally I had tried to implement a weight sensor, but the sensor would only read non garbage values (values that did not wildly fluctuate)
          when the two pads were touching. So I decided to switch over to try and creating a liquid Volume Sensor
        </p>

          <img src = "week6Assets/all-electronics-pic.jpg" style="max-height: 400px;"> </img>
        </div>
        <p>
          How the volume sensor works it you have ot cooper plates on opposite sides of a container (they do not need to be on opposite sides just no touching). 
          Then you have one plate hooked up to ground and the other hooked up to a pin to analogRead from (A3). You then pass current through the plates via a 
          tx pin (4), and see the difference between current you when sending current vs not sending current through the tx pin, as the volume of water changes
          so does the current passing through the plates which means that if you properly calibrate your sensor you can determine the volume of water in a container
          by the current you read from your sensor.
        </p>

        <h4>Calibration:</h4>
        <img src = "week6Assets/capacitive-calibration.png"> </img>
        <p>
          After measuring the voltage reported by the capactive sensor compared to the ml of water 
          in the container the coefficient of the line of best fit was -58.99,
          so for every ml increase in the container the voltage reading by the capactive sensor drops by -58.99 . 
          With the intercept being 38455. 
        </p>
        <p>
          However, one thing to note is that as I was calibrating my sensor any reading before 200 ml was giving readings with negative 
          values and then after 200 ml the readings from the sensor became positive, but I do not know why the readings flip from negative 
          to positive 
        </p>
        <h2>Distance Based Laptop Volume Control</h2>
        <p>
          For the other sensor I chose to use an ultrasonic sensor, if I am being completely honest, because it looked like it had a pair of
          binoculars on. However, measure distance also seemed like it had a lot of potential for a project. One of the first ideas I had was
          that when you are farther away from your computer you want it to be louder and when you are closer you want it to be quieter. So I thought
          of making a robot that controlled the volume on your laptop by how close you are to it.

        <p>
          The code works by finding the distance of the closest object to the sensor and relaying that information.
          It then takes that the number given by the sensor and maps it to a number between 0 and 75 (I chose the mapping
          I did by just playing around with it and finding what mapping was not took loud, or increase in volume to quickly
          or slowly)
